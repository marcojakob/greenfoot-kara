# GreenfootKara

GameGridKara is a combination of the mini-world 
[Kara](http://www.swisseduc.ch/compscience/karatojava/index.html) and [Greenfoot](www.greenfoot.org) 
to teach introductory programming in Java.

For more on Kara see these [resources in German](http://www.swisseduc.ch/informatik/karatojava/).

## Why Greenfoot and Kara?
The concept of Kara has proven itself over years for motivating beginning programmers. Kara is a 
programmable ladybug, who lives in a simple graphical world and must solve problems of varying 
difficulty, for example, collect leafs or find his way through a labyrinth.

Greenfoot is a development environment for Java. It allows a very rapid development of interactive, 
graphical projects.

Greenfoot is great for novice programmers because one doesn’t have to deal with many of the big 
difficulties (like public static void main(String []) and such). Nevertheless, Greenfoot is real 
Java and leaves all options open. Thus, advanced students can also realize very complex projects.

**GreenfootKara combines the proven concept of Kara with Greenfoot’s flexibility and ease of use.**
