GreenfootKara is a combination of the mini-world 
[Kara](http://www.swisseduc.ch/compscience/karatojava/index.html) and [Greenfoot](www.greenfoot.org) 
to teach introductory programming in Java.


## Why Greenfoot and Kara? ##
The concept of Kara has proven itself over years for motivating beginning programmers. Kara is a 
programmable ladybug, who lives in a simple graphical world and must solve problems of varying 
difficulty, for example, collect leafs or find his way through a labyrinth.

Greenfoot is a development environment for Java. It allows a very rapid development of interactive, 
graphical projects.

Greenfoot is great for novice programmers because one doesn't have to deal with many of the big 
difficulties (like public static void main(String []) and such). Nevertheless, Greenfoot is real 
Java and leaves all options open. Thus, advanced students can also realize very complex projects.

**GreenfootKara combines the proven concept of Kara with Greenfoot's flexibility and ease of use.**


## Teaching Resources ##
To download the handouts and GreenfootKara scenarios go to the following websites:
* [GreenfootKara Downloads in English](http://www.swisseduc.ch/informatik/karatojava/greenfootkara/greenfootkara-english.html)
* [GreenfootKara Downloads in German](http://www.swisseduc.ch/informatik/karatojava/greenfootkara/index.html)

## How to use the Source on GitHub ##
This project on GitHub contains an eclipse project that contains the source of GreenfootKara and all the scenarios. There is a source folder for the Kara classes and a source folder for the scenarios of each chapter.

To build all Greenfoot scenarios you should use the Ant build file (build.xml). This will ...
* ... create a target folder containing the scenarios (with and without solutions)
* ... create another folder containing zip files with scenarios zipped by chapter
