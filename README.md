GreenfootKara is a combination of the mini-world 
[Kara](http://www.swisseduc.ch/compscience/karatojava/index.html) and [Greenfoot](http://www.greenfoot.org) 
to teach introductory programming in Java.


## Tutorials

The tutorials and teaching material is on the following websites:

* [GreenfootKara in English](http://code.makery.ch/java/greenfoot-kara-intro)
* [GreenfootKara in German](http://code.makery.ch/java/greenfoot-kara-intro-de)


## How to use the Source on GitHub

This repository on GitHub contains an eclipse project that contains the source of GreenfootKara and all the scenarios. There is a source folder for the Kara classes and a source folder for the scenarios of each chapter.

To build all Greenfoot scenarios you should use the Ant build file (build.xml). This will ...

* ... create a target folder containing the scenarios (with and without solutions)
* ... create another folder containing zip files with scenarios zipped by chapter
